# How to complete Lab #6 quickly

1) Create a repo (GitHub/GitLab). Add any small web app or use your coursework project.
2) Create three branches: `fix/hash`, `fix/sql`, `fix/validation`.
3) Copy the PR templates from this folder into your repo `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` (or paste into description).
4) Open three PRs from those branches. Link to created issues.
5) Use `review_checklist.md` and leave **inline reviewer comments** tying each issue to a CWE/OWASP item.
6) Export this Word report (`Security_Code_Review_Report.docx`), replace placeholders with your real URLs and screenshots.
7) Submit the report + PR links.
